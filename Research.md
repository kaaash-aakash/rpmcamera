- Relation between fps, duration and No of Frames.
    **FPS = No of Frames/ duration**

- [question] What happens when we take a video at 60 fps.
lets imagine a new unit called rusec and let 1 rusec = 1/120s
    0 - 1 = 1st frame
    1 - 2 = wait
    2 - 3 = second frame
    3 - 4 = wait
    ...
    ...
    118 - 119 = 60th frame
    119 - 120 = wait

res data:
fidget.mp4: 14348 frames
fand30fps:  84 frames

- the end of video there is some random black fames because of which the video has wrong duration and hence fps. If that is removes the fps is 
    **denoted_fps/1.001**
